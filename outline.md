# Outline

## Why experiment?

- We have built a new feature for platform and want to know whether the platform is the better of worse for it.
- How can we know?
- First, let's make the question more precise.
- What we care about is a comparison of two states of the world.
- We want a comparison of the state of the world with and without our new feature.
- Ideally, we'd clone the world and release the feature in one world and not the other, keep everything else the same, and compare outcomes.
- We can't do that.
- What can we do?
- We could compare outcomes from before and after the release of the feature.
- If nothing has changed in the world but the release of our feature, then this gives us the same result as our ideal scenario above.
- But nothing never changes in the world.
- If we find that outcomes after the release differ from outcomes from before we can never know whether that is because of our feature or whether the observed difference would have occurred regardless – because of a change in season, a big piece of world news, a change in customer preferences, or any of many other possible reasons or a mix thereof.
- What else can we do?
- We can show the feature to one group of customers and withhold it from another group and compare outcomes between these two groups.
- If nothing but exposure to the feature is different between the two groups then this approach, too, gives us the same answer as our infeasible ideal approach above.
- Whether or not there *is* a difference between the two groups of customers depends on how we select customers for those groups: do we put high-value customers in one group and occasional customers in another? Or customers from one region in one and customers from another region in the other group? All such manual approaches raise concerns – some more obvious than others.
- An experiment is the best tool we have to maximise our chance that the two groups are, indeed the same.
