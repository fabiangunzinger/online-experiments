# Introduction

Online experiments are widely used for product development in the tech industry.

As a result, a large literaure on best-prectices and increasingly advancede methods has developed over the past 20 years. Furthermore, there is now also a thriving small community of practitioners who discuss new ideas on LinkedIn. Finally, there is a number of textbooks, both online ([here](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html), [here](https://alexdeng.github.io/causal)) and in print, as well as class notes that cover aspects of the statistical foundations in depth.

The aim of these notes is twofold: to cover the statistical foundations of online experiments without any shortcuts â€“ including step-by-step proofs of the key results, and to cover that content as concisely as possible. Apart from the line-by-line proofs little of the content here is new. But the resources mentioned above don't usually cover all the same content in on place and often provide abbreviated profs and have more elaborate discussions.

I created them mailnly for personal reference because I forget stuff. But if you find the notes helpful, find any errors, or have any suggestions, please get in touch by writing to <fa.gunzinger@gmail.com>.
