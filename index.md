# Introduction {.unnumbered}

Online experiments are widely used for product development in the tech industry. As a result, a large literature on practices and increasingly advanced methods has developed over the past 20 years. Much of this literature is summarised in [this review article](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2023.2257237) by Larsen and coauthors, and the standard textbook treatment on online experiments is [Kohavi, Tang, and Xu](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/trustworthy-online-controlled-experiments/D97B26382EB0EB2DC2019A7A7B518F59). There is also a thriving small community of practitioners who discuss new ideas on LinkedIn. In addition, aspects of the statistical foundations of online experiments are covered in excellent textbooks online ([here](https://mixtape.scunning.com/), [here](https://matheusfacure.github.io/python-causality-handbook/landing-page.html), [here](https://alexdeng.github.io/causal)) and in print (e.g. [here](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/71126BE90C58F1A431FE9B2DD07938AB), [here](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691120355/mostly-harmless-econometrics), [here](https://www.routledge.com/Causal-Inference-What-If/Hernan-Robins/p/book/9781420076165)), as well as in publicly available class notes ([here](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/causal_inf_book.pdf), [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18793)). Finally, there is an excellent repo that collects resources on causal inference [here](https://github.com/matteocourthoud/awesome-causal-inference).

What I could not find is a reference that covers the statistical foundations of online experiments concisely but without shortcuts (e.g. by including step-by-step proofs of key results). This is what these notes aim to provide.

I created them mainly for my own reference, thinking that they might evolve over time as I deepen my understanding of key concepts and have time to add further content â€“ we'll see how that goes. In the meantime, if you find them helpful, find errors, or have any suggestions, please get in touch by writing to <experimentstats.playpen453@passmail.net>.
